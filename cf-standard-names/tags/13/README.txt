This XML file is used to build the HTML version of the CF Standard Name Table.

See the makefile for the avilable document build options.

The HTML version of the document currently requires an external JavaScript
file, which is automatically included by Plone. For local testing, it is
necessary to copy the contents of the JavaScript file into a <script> tag in
the XSLT file.

The .js file is located on the web server at:
/usr/local/zopeinstance1/Products/CMFPlone/skins/plone_ecmascript/toggleHelp.js

For local testing purposes, you can simply copy the .js from the source of a
Plone web page.
