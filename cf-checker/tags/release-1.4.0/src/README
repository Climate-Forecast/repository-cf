README

To run the CF file conformance checker you must have the following 
non-standard python modules installed on your system:

     - UDUNITS
     - CDMS
     - Numeric

How to install CDMS:
---------------------
The CDMS module is part of the CDAT distribution available from the
sourceforge website (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdat).  
Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to install only the CDMS module.
So, for the moment it is recommended that you install the whole of CDAT.  
If you wish to install CDAT using the version of python you already have 
installed on your system, then I believe you will need to have write 
permission to the python directory, since the CDAT installation copies 
the python modules to it.

This dependency on CDAT is not ideal.  It is hoped that in the future,
the installation process will be made more modular/flexible allowing
CDMS alone to be installed and making it easier to use your own version
of python.  This is being actively raised with PCMDI.

How to install UDUNITS:
------------------------

*****************************************************************************
IMPORTANT:  

You must have the version of udunits shipped with the CF checker
for it to work.  This version of udunits contains the python interface to
the package which is not part of any other udunits release.
*****************************************************************************

After unpacking the tar file go into the src directory. General 
Instructions for installation are in the INSTALL file.  The 
HOW_TO_INSTALL_ON_HPS file details the changes that have been made for 
the python interface. There are a couple of hard wires to the Hadley Centre 
paths which will obviously need to be changed. (Eventually, the installation 
procedure will be more generic.) Basically, you will need to run the usual 
./configure and then make.

If you are installing UDUNITS on LINUX:
----------------------------------------
To install on a Linux system you will need to make the following few 
changes to the src/lib/Makefile.in file.

1. Instead of creating a _udunits.sl file you will need to change this to
   have the extension .so.

2. In the python_build target the options to the 'ld' command will be
   different.  Remove the -b and replace with -shared.

To run the CF checker:
-----------------------
1. Change the line 
       udunits.utInit("/opt/ukmo/hadley/etc/udunits.dat") 
   to point to the location of udunits.dat on your system. It should be
   in the udunits-1.11.7/etc directory.

2. Run the checker by typing:
      cfchecks.py <netCDF_file.nc>
