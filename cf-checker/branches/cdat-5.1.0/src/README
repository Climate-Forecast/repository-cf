To run the CF file conformance checker you must have the following 
installed on your system:

     - UDUNITS2
     - CDMS (part of CDAT-5.x)



How to install CDMS:
---------------------
The CDMS module is part of the CDAT distribution available from the
sourceforge website (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdat).  
Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to install only the CDMS module.
So, for the moment it is recommended that you install the whole of CDAT.  
If you wish to install CDAT using the version of python you already have 
installed on your system, then I believe you will need to have write 
permission to the python directory, since the CDAT installation copies 
the python modules to it.

This dependency on CDAT is not ideal.  It is hoped that in the future,
the installation process will be made more modular/flexible allowing
CDMS alone to be installed and making it easier to use your own version
of python.  This is being actively raised with PCMDI.


How to install UDUNITS:
------------------------






To run the CF checker:
-----------------------

1. Make sure that the cdms library is in your PYTHONPATH
   export PYTHONPATH=

2. Make sure that the path to the udunits libraries are in the system 
   library path or alternatively set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   E.g. $PREFIX/lib    where $PREFIX is the --prefix option you passed to the configure script when installing udunits.
3. Edit setting for

1. Change the line 
       udunits.utInit("/opt/ukmo/hadley/etc/udunits.dat") 
   to point to the location of udunits.dat on your system. It should be
   in the udunits-1.11.7/etc directory.

2. Run the checker by typing:
      cfchecks.py <netCDF_file.nc>
